# Readme - Part A - Assignment 6 INFO 6150 Web Design and User Experience
### This part uses the implementation of jQuery to verify the fields such as username, password and email fields of user and will logs him/her into the application to use the calculator.
*It includes the jQuery script through the cdn website using script tag.*
*Usage of Bootstrap: We have imported latest version of bootstrap from cdn and linked it using the link tag and animations script through script tag.*
*Tables - to organize the entire application, we use tables from bootstrap such that application goes responsive to mobile and desktop and uses the rows and columns to store the labels and input fields of username, email and password.*
*Password works in a better way such that initially all the requirements go red, and as user enters the password, then entire password is checked using the regular expressions and each field in requirements go green on verification.*
*Log in button when pressed, checks for the validations, when every field is validated, then the application goes into next page called as calculator.*
### Calculator Application
*In this application, we have 2 inputs which accepts the numbers in both fields and validates them. Once validation is successful on clicking any button, the operation present on that button will be performed.*
*These inputs are taken and operation is performed and the results are reflected in the results box.*
